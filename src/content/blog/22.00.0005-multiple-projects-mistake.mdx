I made a mistake at work recently. Here's what I learned.

## The setup

I started a new job and it looked like my job would be to migrate one large business system from its current location ('on-premises' as we say in the business) to 'the cloud'.

<JDB2
  text={`
10-19 Administration
   14 Timesheets & expenses
      14.01 Timesheets for 2301
      14.02 Timesheets for 2302
      ...
      14.19 Timesheets for 2319
`}
  options={{
    project: true,
  }}
/>
