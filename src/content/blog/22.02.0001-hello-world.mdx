I thought I'd use this first post to explain the numbering scheme.

As you might expect, each post has an ID. This post's ID is `22.00.0001`.

Blog posts are [breaking the rules](/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.02-exceptions-to-the-rules/). I wanted to give them some sort of identifier but in the context of the [broader site](/) they don't fit in the overall structure.

Imagine if every post had a Johnny.Decimal ID. My navigation tree would soon get out of control.

This is a nice example of [why I save the `00` numbers](/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.03-what-about-00-09/). In this case I'm using `22.00`, which is the 'meta' ID for the blog category, as an ID to represent **all blog posts**.

Each post then gets its own supplementary ID, starting from `0001`. (I'm assuming I'll never write more than 10,000 posts.)<FootRef n={1} />

    "Let's say I write a post a day. 365 days/year means I could easily hit 1,000 in a couple of years, but at the same rate I'd need to do a post a day until the year 2050. Unlikely.",
