I thought I'd use this first post to explain the numbering scheme.

As you might expect, each post has an ID. This post's ID is `22.00.0001`.

Blog posts are [breaking the rules](/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.02-exceptions-to-the-rules/). I wanted to give them some sort of identifier but in the context of the [broader site](/) they don't fit in the overall structure.

Imagine if every post had a Johnny.Decimal ID: `22.01`, `22.02`, and so on. My navigation tree would soon get out of control. And I'd run out of numbers quite quickly.

This is a nice example of [why I save the `00` numbers](/10-19-concepts/12-advanced/12.03-what-about-00-09/). In this case I'm using `22.00`, which is the 'meta' ID for the blog category, as an ID to represent **all blog posts**.

Each post then gets its own supplementary ID, starting from `0001`. (I'm assuming I'll never write more than 10,000 posts.)<FootRef n={1} />

## Accessing the posts

The main site has a couple of IDs dedicated to **viewing lists of posts.**

There's [`22.01`](/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.01-latest-posts/) which shows the full content of the latest posts, and [`22.02`](/20-29-communication/22-blog/22.02-all-posts/) which is an index of _all_ posts but only their titles.

If I add 'tags' to future posts, I might use `22.03` and upwards to show pages that list blog posts with a specific tag.

## I'm just having a bit of fun with this

None of this was really necessary. :-)

    "Let&rsquo;s say I write a post a day. 365 days/year means I could easily hit 1,000 in a couple of years, but at the same rate I&rsquo;d need to do that until the year 2050 to get close to 10,000. Unlikely.",
