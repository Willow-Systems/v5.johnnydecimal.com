I didn't love the job, and a late-Sunday-night conversation with my partner Lucy turned in to me resigning the next morning. Hardly spur of the moment -- this has been coming for some time -- but not what either of us had 'planned'.

The turn of events saw me free by Tuesday afternoon. Laptops and badges handed in. Quite surreal.

And so here I am: Johnny.Decimal. My job. (I need to think of something to write in the 'occupation' box; suggestions welcome.)
