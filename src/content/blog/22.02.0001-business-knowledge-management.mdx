There's this whole corner of the internet dedicated to [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). It's [massive](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=personal+knowledge+management).

People spent hours of their spare time on this. They [hang out in forums](https://forum.obsidian.md/search?q=pkm). They mail me and ask for guidance. They agonise over this stuff at home...

...and then they go to work and it's like it never happened.

Why is this okay?
