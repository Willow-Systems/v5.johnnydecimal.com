# Support me :-)

I have a normal job, which limits the time I can spend developing this thing. I'd _love_ for Johnny.Decimal to become the thing that pays the bills.

If you would like to support me -- no pressure, this will always be free, only do it if you can afford it -- here's how you can.

- [Sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/johnnydecimal).
- [Buy me a coffee on ko.fi](https://ko-fi.com/johnnydecimal).
- [Just give me a hundred dollars via Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/bIY3dx4ph4BWedO000).<FootRef n={1} />

## Interested in learning Excel?

My partner and I spent much of 2022 creating an Excel course. We think it's really good. I teach her -- a total Excel newbie -- how to use Excel. It's called &lsquo;[Learn with Lucy](https://www.learnwithlucy.rocks/courses/excel)&rsquo;.

We spent ages planning the course. Everything she learned, she learned on camera. And now she can use Excel. So it works.

It's US$47, but you'll actually get something for your money. We believe that at the end you'll understand Excel better than most people.

If you're already an expert, you could always buy it for a friend or family member.
