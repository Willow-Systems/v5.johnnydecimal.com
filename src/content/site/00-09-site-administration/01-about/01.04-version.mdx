## I re-wrote everything :-)

New site, new structure, new everything.

The new structure makes it _much_ simpler for me to add content, and I promise that I will do that.

You should check back here often, or [follow the Mastodon account](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal), or [sign up to the mailing list](/00-09-site-administration/02-send-and-receive/02.02-mailing-list/).

## Release cycle

I will publish content updates as one single update to the site on or around the first weekend of the month.

The version number will update accordingly. [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org) is used:

- MAJOR, `5._._`: a total site re-write. I hope never to have to do this again.
- MINOR, `_.0._`: content updates. This number will increase when I do a monthly release.
- PATCH, `_._.0`: fixing errors: spelling mistakes, updating broken links, other small tweaks. I'll make these changes as-needed.
