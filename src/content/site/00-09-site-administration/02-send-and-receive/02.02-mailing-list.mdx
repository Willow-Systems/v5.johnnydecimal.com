First up: I'm not an email address collector. I don't _want_ your email address. But it can be useful to have.

You should familiarise yourself with my [privacy policy](/00-09-site-administration/01-about/01.03-privacy) if you haven't already.

There are two lists.

## Default: Leave me the hell alone

If you want me to mail you when _gigantic_ things happen here, and otherwise leave you the hell alone, this is the list for you. You might get an email a year, if that. I'm not kidding.

## Opt-in: I'm bored at work

Some of you like email. I think that's weird, but you do you.

I don't know what this will look like yet, but if enough of you indicate that you'd actually like me to be a bit more chatty, I'll figure it out.

If you would like something in the order of an email a month, this is the list for you.
