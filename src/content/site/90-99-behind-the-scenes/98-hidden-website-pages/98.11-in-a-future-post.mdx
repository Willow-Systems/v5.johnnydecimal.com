# In a future post...

As of April 2023 I'm still writing the new version of this site.

Rather than wait until it's 100% finished, I'm linking things that I know I _will_ write, but that don't exist yet, to this page.

If you're reading this, you've found one of those things.

For updates follow along via [RSS](/00-09-site-administration/02-send-and-receive/02.03-rss-feed), sign up to the [mailing list](/00-09-site-administration/02-send-and-receive/02.02-mailing-list), keep an eye on the [version](/00-09-site-administration/01-about/01.04-version) page, follow me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@johnnydecimal), or just check back manually like it's 1999.

# To-do

I might as well keep my to-do list here. If there's anything you want added, or any posts you'd like me to prioritise, just ask.

## Site-wide

- [ ] Make sure all images have good alt text.
- [ ] Give all images a 1x fallback JPG.
- [ ] Fix the favicon.
- [ ] Fix the 404. If you add text to a valid URL the navbar is weird. And it isn't working on Netlify.
- [ ] Redirect all pages from v4.
- [ ] Redirect play.johnnydecimal.com and shut that down.

## 11.01 Home

- [ ] Link 'either copy it' to the library.

## 11.05 The index

- [ ] Example: having your system spread across multiple domains. xxx.16.12 will only be on DOF/Outlook so you put that in the note and now you don't have to try to figure out where the hell it is.
- [ ] Using Bear with Alfred's plugin: so now you're a quick `bs` away from finding any number.
- [ ] Might be worth noting that this would be the focus of any software that you write. Can anyone help?
- [ ] Create the list of suitable apps.
- [ ] Use Bear's nested tags.

## 11.06 Saving files

- [ ] Pros vs. cons of putting the JD number in the file name.
