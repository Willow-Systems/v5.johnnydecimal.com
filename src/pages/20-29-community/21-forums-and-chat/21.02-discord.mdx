If chat's your thing, join [the Discord](http://discord.gg/KYWzAJhmPv).

I'll confess that this is neglected. I prefer [the forum](/20-29-community/21-forums-and-chat/21.01-the-forum), personally -- Discord feels chaotic to me.

Maybe I'm just too old. The last game I played with any regularity was Doom... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
