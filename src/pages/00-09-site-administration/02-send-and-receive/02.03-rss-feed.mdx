# {frontmatter.title} ~~ currently broken

The site has one. Your feed reader should discover it.

If it doesn't pick it up, the URL is https://johnnydecimal.com/rss.xml.

~~It's currently really basic, and doesn't include the full content of every post. That's near the top of my list to fix, I want the feed to be as good as the site.~~

It's so broken I've disabled it for now, rather than mess up your feeds. Sorry. I'll fix it this week (1st May '23).

## Update 2023-05-07

I've been working on this all day, not fixed yet but it's coming.

When I started this site rebuild, Astro's [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) hadn't been released. Now they have, and their support for full-content RSS feeds is much better. They're just much better overall.

So that's the _actual_ job: migrate to Content Collections. I'm 80% there. I'm fixing up some of the code stink while I'm at it.
