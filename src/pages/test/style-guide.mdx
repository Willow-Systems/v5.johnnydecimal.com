# H1 header

With some text after it.

Headers have `font-family` at weight `700`. They have margin which is different depending whether they're `:first-child`.

They have a custom `line-height` and of course the border in lieu of underlines. We like that big fat border.

## H2 header

These sentences are in `div.jdcontent p` which has some `margin` applied top/bottom to space it out, `font-size` and `line-height`.

Note that `font-size` is `18`, the site default being `16`.

### H3 header

Words usually follow.

---

# New & improved footnotes

This section is near the top so that you can test jumping around.<FootRef n={1} />

Here's `<FootRef n={2} />`:

I write some words and then I make a footnote.<FootRef n={2} />

And here's

`<Footnote footnotes={[ "one", "two" ]} />`

# All the styles

(Which was preceded by a horizontal break.)

_Italics are underscores in MDX. This is all italics at weight 400._

**Bold is double stars. This is bold at 700.**

We tend not to do _**bold in italics but if we did, it would look like this.**_ That's also at 700.

---

This text is in Markdown backticks: `backticks`. That renders in `div.jdcontent p code`, which is Astro default behaviour.

We style that using `.jdcontent code` and that's where it gets the borders, colour, and a touch of `padding-inline`.

### `div.jdcontent`

Minimal styling. We give it some `margin` and set the `font-family`.

### Superscript

We can <sup>1</sup> use the `<sup>` tag and get superscript. You're controlling the size and font, and the browser is doing the rest.

### Lists

This is an ordered list:

1. First item, which is really long so it's going to overflow a couple of lines. How does it look? Don't forget to check it on mobile as well, it might be different.
2. Second
3. Third

And this is unordered:

- Last item, which isn't last, but we're unordered! It's chaos I tell you, chaos. When will it end?!!2on1!
- Middle
- First? Welp!

You've tweaked the `list-style` properties, and removed some padding.

### Links

Links! [This is a link](#) and it should have funky hover effects. [This is a link](/) that you have visited.

### Images

Don't bother importing images using the `![]()` syntax. You can't control for 2x.

Instead just use a trusty `<img>` tag, and specify the image in `srcset` with ` 2x` at the end.

<img
  alt="Test"
  src="/img/11.01-finder-sample-company-expanded.png"
  srcset="/img/11.01-finder-sample-company-expanded.png 2x"
/>

They get a border, some padding, and a shadow. They're left-aligned.

You should probably be serving 1x images as `src` but you're not.

### Footnotes

We reference a footnote<sup>1</sup> with a regular `<sup>`, then pass `number` and `text` to `<JDFootnote />`.

The browser's styles take care of the superscript, and we make the font smaller.

<JDFootnote
  number="1"
  text="Like this one. It flows nicely on to multiple lines, which is always nice."
/>

If we do a blockquote using `>` in an `.mdx` file, we get this:

> This is a blockquote.

---

# `JDBlock`

`<JDBlock />` is a component that renders out a block of stuff that is usually a JD structure.

<JDBlock
  text={`I
am
JDBlock`}
/>

<JDBlock
  text={`
10-19 Area
   11 Category
   11.01 highlight
   11.02 highlight, underline
`}
  classArray={[, , "highlight", "highlight highlight-underline"]}
/>

The text in there ends up in a `.jdBlock > pre`.

You have a VSCode snippet that inserts a demo block: `jdblock`.

Applying class `highlight` does exactly that.

---

# One-offs

`11.01` and `11.03` contain large JD numbers. And of course, wrap them in `<p>` not `<div>`!

`<p class="large-number">AC.ID</p>`:

<p class="large-number">`AC.ID`</p>

The CSS for this is in section 'one-offs' in johnny.scss.

---

# Components

Not going to duplicate them here. They're on:

- [11.02 Areas and categories](/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.02-areas-and-categories)

---

# Colours

Here are all of the colours.

The header there is one of them. It's `$colour-800;`.

The body text here is another. This is `$offblack`.

The page background is `$offwhite`.

But the background of our little code insets there is `$colour-100;`. Their border is obviously `$jd-highlight-colour`.

Don't forget that `box-shadow` has its own values, that you need to consolidate. But do that once you've got the rest of the scheme down.

And of course [links have a colour, both unvisited (this one)](#), and [visited links like this one](https://daringfireball.net).

Don't forget the sidebar's links and WYAB.

<Footnote
  footnotes={[
    "Because if the text there is at the bottom, you don't get much of an effect.",
    "Not so interesting, this footnote.",
  ]}
/>
